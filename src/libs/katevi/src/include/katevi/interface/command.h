    /**
     * \brief An Editor command line command.
     *
     * \section cmd_intro Introduction
     *
     * The Command class represents a command for the editor command line. A
     * command simply consists of a string, for example \e find. The command
     * auto-registers itself at the Editor. The Editor itself queries
     * the command for a list of accepted strings/commands by calling cmds().
     * If the command gets invoked the function exec() is called, i.e. you have
     * to implement the \e reaction in exec(). Whenever the user needs help for
     * a command help() is called.
     *
     * \section cmd_information Command Information
     * To provide reasonable information about a specific command there are the
     * following accessor functions for a given command string:
     *  - name() returns a label
     *  - description() returns a descriptive text
     *  - category() returns a category into which the command fits.
     *
     * These getters allow KTextEditor implementations to plug commands into menus
     * and toolbars, so that a user can assign shortcuts.
     *
     * \section cmd_completion Command Completion
     *
     * The Command optionally can show a completion popup to help the user select
     * a valid entry as first parameter to the Command. To this end, return a
     * valid completion item by reiplementing completionObject().
     *
     * The returned completion object is deleted automatically once it is not needed
     * anymore. Therefore neither delete the completion object yourself nor return
     * the same completion object twice.
     *
     * \section cmd_interactive Interactive Commands
     *
     * In case the Command needs to interactively process the text of the parameters,
     * override wantsToProcessText() by returning @e true and reimplement processText().
     *
     * A typical example of an iterative command would be the incremental search.
     *
